This branch was created for storing the implementation of concurrent collection done so far. Till this point there was no assumption or special casing on the fact that we want to collect concurrently only at depth = 1. There is a mistake in this implementation where some roots are missed because of variable reachability from the stack in the heap that is targetted for collection. One way this can be fixed is by storing the stack at the time of fork. Another way is keep track of up pointers using the write barrier. Note that in principle we only need to do this for left hand side of the computation. Also, the concurrent stack part of it hasn't been tested and is most definitely buggy. Depending on the stage of concurrent-root branch, the correct implementation should be present there.
